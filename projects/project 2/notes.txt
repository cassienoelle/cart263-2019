QUESTIONS

1. Why is my document returning null without window.onload (none of the examples or tutorials mention this problem)
2. How does the loop work? Functions seem to run without being explicitly called so how do I best organize the code?
3. How do I properly extend the PIXI classes to use OOP to instantiate the buttons (extend Graphics class?)
4. when using requestAnimationFrame instead of ticker why do I get this error message even though the code still works (why would nudibranch suddently be undefined?)
script.js:90 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
    at gameLoop (script.js:90)
    at script.js:93
gameLoop @ script.js:90
(anonymous) @ script.js:93




TO DO
// 1. take out circle params from resize() function
2. use aliases where appropriate


USEFUL INFO TO REMEMBER
1. A WEBGL-ready image is called a texture
